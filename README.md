Hello ! I'm Alexis Oizel Doffin, going online as Akareki.

I'm currently learning at 42 Lyon. For the moment I code almost exclusively in C, but I will soon start learning C++.
I was a math teacher in a previous life, so I"m very interested in data science, physics engine, AI and efficient algorithms.
